# rneu2022

Repo for the code behind my [React Native EU](https://www.react-native.eu) 2022 talk, "How to access all the Objectiveâ€‘C APIs using JSI". A cleaner version of [shirakaba/react-native-native-runtime](https://github.com/shirakaba/react-native-native-runtime).

## Installation

```sh

# Now run the main target on your device of choice.
```
